I am starting my master's degree at Max Planck Institute's (Saarland University) under the supervision of Dr. Christoph Lenzen next Fall. Also, I have graduated from Isfahan University of Technologhy. I had four internships with Max Planck Institute under supervision of Dr. Lenzen. I am interested in Algorithms design, Graph algorithms, Approximation algorithms, and online algorithms
I love drawing, biking, and badminton. Recently started bouldering.
