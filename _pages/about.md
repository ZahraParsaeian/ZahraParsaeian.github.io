I am starting my master's degree at Max Planck Institute's (Saarland University) under the supervision of <a \href = "https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~clenzen/">Dr. Christoph Lenzen<\a> next Fall. Also, I have graduated from Isfahan University of Technologhy. I had two internships with Max Planck Institute under supervision of Dr. Lenzen. I am interested in Algorithms design, Graph algorithms, Approximation algorithms, and online algorithms. \\
I love drawing, biking, and bouldering.
