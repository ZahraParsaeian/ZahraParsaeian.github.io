I am a master's student at Max Planck Institute for Informatics (Saarland University) and I am <a href = "https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~clenzen/">Dr. Christoph Lenzen's</a> Hiwi. Also, I have graduated from Isfahan University of Technologhy. I had two internships with Max Planck Institute under supervision of Dr. Lenzen. I am interested in Algorithms design, Graph algorithms, Approximation algorithms, and online algorithms. \\
I love drawing, biking, and bouldering.
