The following is the list and details of my projects:
* <strong>Users’ behavioral detection (Summer 2018)</strong>

  * We have designed and implemented a distributed recommender system using spark in order to optimizing the
search engine results based on the past user behaviors.
* <strong>Facial Expression Recognition (Spring 2018)</strong>
  * Supervisor: Dr. Mohammad Hossein Manshaei
  * We have tested different types of convolutional neural networks in order to achieve the best perfomance in
detecting the face’s expression of the person in front of the camera.
