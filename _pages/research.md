The following is the list and details of my researches:
* <strong>Stable Marriage Problem (Feb 2020, present)</strong>
  * Supervisor: Dr. Christoph Lenzen
  * Scientific Intern, Max Planck Institute for Informatics
  * The stable marriage problem is to find a matching between men and women, considering preference lists in which each person expresses his/her preference over the
members of the opposite gender. The output matching must be stable, which intuitively means that there is no man-woman pair both of which prefer each other to their current spouse. Limiting the stable marriage problem reduces its complexity. One of the limitations is the k-list model, which distributes men/women (uniformly/non-uniformly) in k groups so that men/women in each group have the same preference lists. We are working on an algorithm that can construct the preference lists and enumerate the number of stable matchings for a bad cut.

* <strong>Straggler Mitigation in Distributed Matrix Multiplication (2018 - Sep 2019)</strong>
  * Supervisor: Dr. Farzad Parvaresh
  * Finding the optimal number of workers depend on the size of the input matrices to decrease the message passing load and consequently have better multiplication complexity.
  
* <strong>Gray Code addition (Aug 2019 - Dec 2019)</strong>
  * Supervisor: Dr. Christoph Lenzen
  * Scientific Intern, Max Planck Institute for Informatics
  * To decrease the addition circuit depth, I am finding a parallel way to add two gray codes instead of adding
them sequentially bit by bit. Also, finding a way to add gray codes directly rather than convert them to boolean
numbers, adding them in a binary system, and finally convert the result to gray code.
